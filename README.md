# Getting Started :


Clone the repository:

Navigate into the project folder:
cd TicTacToe

Open index.html in any modern web browser.



# Usage :


Players take turns placing X and O.

First player to get three in a row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) wins.

If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

# Project Structure :


index.html → main HTML file
styles.css → styling for the game
script.js → game logic



# How it Works :


A turn tracker decides which player’s move it is.

When a cell is clicked, the player’s symbol (X or O) is placed.

The script checks for winning combinations or a draw.

Game stops when someone wins or the board is full.

Reset clears the board for a new round.

Improved design and animations

Scoreboard for multiple rounds

Option to choose starting player
